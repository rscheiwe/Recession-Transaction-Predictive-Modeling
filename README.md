# Recession Transaction Predictive Modling

This project is in two stages. The first stage is to predict housing transaction prices with an average error of under $70, based on available financial data of a housing investment trust during a timeframe which spans the housing market recession of ~2008-2009. The second stage is to use the predicted housing transaction prices to analyze said prices in relation to the recession and any future recession(s) in the housing market.
